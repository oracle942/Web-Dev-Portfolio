# Web-Dev-Portfolio
This is a one-page Web-Development portfolio showcasing my work. 
I created this portfolio to showcase my current and upcoming projects. 
This portfolio also serves the purpose of satisfying the requirements 
for the second homework assignment of the coding bootcamp I am enrolled in. 
This is a valuable learning exprience in html, css, gitbash, and github.
